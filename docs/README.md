### Introduction

The Modular Algorithm Rendering System is a personal project developed to visualize classic sorting and searching algorithms. It serves as a dynamic tool to demonstrate how different algorithms approach the task of organizing and finding elements within randomly generated lists.

### Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** See sorting and searching algorithms in action with real-time animations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily select algorithms and adjust speed parameter to understand their behavior on different arrays.
- **Educational Resource:** Enhances understanding of algorithm efficiency and complexity through direct observation and comparison.

### How to Use

1. Chose a dataset size and randomise the datum.
2. Select an algorithm from the available options (more coming soon)!
3. Adjust visualization speed according to your preference.
4. Click 'visualize!' to start the animation and observe the algorithm at work.
5. Skip to End if you wish to fast-forward to the end of the visualization and see the final result.
